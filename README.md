## How to run the server
We need a server to serve the lib files needed to run the client. You may run it with:

```shell-session
./server.sh
```

To start watching for changes (and compile the first time):

```shell-session
./run.sh
```

## Compiler
The compiler will take the ./templates/_index.html file and import the files. The resulting file will be ./index.html
